# The application's route configuration.
#
# This file stores the routes of the application. Additional files may reside in
# the 'routes' subdirectory, if neccessary.
#
# Example:
#   index:
#     path: /
#     controller: App\Controller\DefaultController::index
#
#
# NOTE: Even if this file is empty, it is required by the Kernel and MUST NOT be
#       removed.

# Register the BrowserController.
#
# As the BrowserController implements catch-all routes, all other routes need to
# be defined before the ones of this controller get defined. As this file gets
# loaded last in the Kernel, this controller will be registered at the bottom of
# this file.
