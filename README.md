## About

Meant to be a learning project on how to work with Symfony 4, this project
provides a simple file browser written in PHP.

Unlike other file managers, this one is pretty minimalistic: It just prints the
contents of a directory and implements password protection. Additional features
include providing "share" links and inviting users to upload data.
